# Group 76 Project - Animal Conservation Tracker

The Animal Conservation Tracker, is a tool for wildlife groups to manage data related to conservation movements. It aims to model the various progress and efforts towards protecting certain conservation areas, including different species of
animals, tracking the animals with devices, specific staff and their duties, conservational projects and activities, and observations. A few examples of the tracker's added functionalities include inserting a new species, deleting a species
from the database, updating a species' information, and much more. The project is completed using PHP and SQL with the Oracle Database system.
